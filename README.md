# Pre-work - *TipCalC*

**TipCalC** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Darshit Dave**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Y] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [Y] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [N] UI animations
* [N] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [N] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [N] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [1] Added a feature of Tax. User can select the state and app will pull up the percentage amount that would apply on the bill. I used view picker to make that.

## Notes

I were new to the app making process so had some chanllenges working with usually UI development. Nothing major.
